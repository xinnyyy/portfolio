## Overview

This project explores **Beijing’s housing market** to uncover the key factors driving property prices and regional investment potential.  
Using statistical analysis and data visualization, the team identified relationships between **location, property type, and pricing trends**, answering core business questions such as *what*, *where*, *which*, and *when* to invest.

## Objectives

- 🏙️ Identify the major **factors influencing housing prices**.  
- 📍 Determine **which districts offer the best investment opportunities**.  
- 🏠 Compare **property types and pricing patterns** across regions.  
- ⏰ Assess **optimal timing for property investment**.

---

## Approach

- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a structured Beijing housing dataset.  
- Created **geospatial heatmaps and scatterplots** to visualise price density, demand, and supply.  
- Applied **correlation analysis** and regression to quantify relationships between key variables (e.g., distance to city centre, property size, and year built).  

---

## Key Insights

- Distance to city centre heavily affected house of prices
- Significantly higher prices for Bungalows since Demand greatly exceeded Supply
- Presence of Subway contributed the most to higher prices
