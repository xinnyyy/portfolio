## Overview

**MatchUp** is a web-based sports networking platform designed to simplify how users find, organize, and join sports games.  
Built as part of the **BT3103 Application Systems Development for Business Analytics** module, the platform connects players by **sport type, location, and experience level** — helping them discover games that suit their skill level and availability.

The application bridges a common gap in the sports community: casual players often struggle to find teammates or suitable matches. MatchUp creates an engaging ecosystem that combines **match discovery, chat communication, and personalized profiles** to foster active, healthy, and social lifestyles.

## Key Objectives

- ⚡ **Simplify Game Discovery** – Enable users to find and join games based on location, sport, and skill level.  
- 💬 **Enhance Communication** – Integrate real-time chatrooms for every match, ensuring seamless coordination.  
- 🧭 **Encourage Community Building** – Foster social interaction and long-term engagement among players.  
- 📱 **Streamline Organization** – Allow users to easily create, manage, and track their own listings.  
- 🧩 **Ensure Scalability** – Design a modular system capable of supporting diverse sports and user growth.

## Core Features

### 🏠 Landing & Registration
- Users are welcomed by an intuitive landing page that explains the platform and prompts them to **sign up or log in**.  
- During registration, users set a profile picture, username, bio, and sports preferences to personalize their experience.

### 🔍 Explore Page
- Users can browse **active sports listings** filtered by sport type, location, and experience level.  
- Expired listings automatically fade out for clarity.  
- Each listing includes game details (e.g., players needed, equipment, cost) and quick actions to **join chats or add to favourites**.

### 💬 Chatrooms
- Every game has a **dedicated chatroom**, allowing joined participants to coordinate details and confirm attendance in real time.  
- A dropdown system lets users switch easily between multiple ongoing chats.

### 👤 User Profiles
- Profiles display the user’s details, preferred sports, and their own created or joined listings.  
- An **Edit Profile** function lets users update their information dynamically without leaving the page.

### ⭐ Favourites
Users can bookmark listings to revisit later.  
A clean layout keeps saved matches organized and allows quick removal or re-joining actions.

## Data & Architecture

- **Frontend Framework:** Vue.js (Single File Components for modular UI)  
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, Hosting)  
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting with GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated deployment  
- **Data Handling:** Firestore serves as the single source of truth with reactive updates across components  
- **Version Control:** GitHub repository with centralized main branch strategy for clarity and team alignment  

Firestore architecture includes three main collections:
- **Users** – stores user profiles, preferences, and joined games  
- **Listings** – holds match details, owner data, and player requirements  
- **Messages** – stores chat messages tied to listing IDs and sender metadata  

---

## Product Management

- The team adopted an **agile sprint-based workflow**, emphasizing incremental feature delivery and live demos during stand-ups.  
- Version control was maintained through GitHub, with every feature documented via clear commits.  
- All deployment was automated through GitHub Actions — each push to the main branch triggered a **Firebase build and deploy pipeline**, ensuring production consistency.

---

## Testing & Validation

### 🧪 Unit Testing
- Conducted with **Vitest** and **Vue Test Utils** using **JSDOM** for UI validation.  
- Firebase functions were **mocked** (e.g., `getAuth`, `signInWithEmailAndPassword`) to enable isolated frontend testing.  
- Tests focused on UI rendering, input validation, chat message flow, and state synchronization.

### 👥 User Testing
- User testing was performed with participants aged 18–25.  
- Testers completed key user flows such as registration, joining games, and chatting.  
- Observations confirmed **strong usability**, intuitive affordance, and effective signifiers (buttons, labels, constraints).  
- Feedback guided interface refinements and confirmation pop-ups for better flow.

---

## Challenges & Learnings

- Coordinating multiple Vue components while maintaining **reactive data flow** across Firestore collections required careful event management.  
- Achieving **real-time synchronization** for chat messages and listings without over-fetching improved the app’s responsiveness.  
- The project strengthened team skills in **modular frontend design, CI/CD pipelines**, and **collaborative agile development**.

---

## Impact & Outcome

MatchUp successfully delivered an engaging, production-ready web app that:
- Simplifies sports matchmaking through data-driven filtering.  
- Enables instant chat-based coordination for players.  
- Promotes active and social lifestyles by lowering entry barriers to casual sports.

Deployed live via Firebase Hosting, the app remains a scalable foundation for future enhancements like:
- Skill-based matchmaking algorithms.  
- Attendance tracking and push notifications.  
- Integration with wearable or fitness APIs.
