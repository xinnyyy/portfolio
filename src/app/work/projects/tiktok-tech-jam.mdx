## **Overview**

BandAI is an AI-driven compliance checker that fuses fine-tuned intelligence with human oversight to ensure faster, safer, and more reliable regulatory audits.  
The project transforms compliance from a reactive, manual process into a proactive, traceable, and auditable workflow.  
By fine-tuning **GPT-4.1-mini** and integrating a **dual-AI architecture** with real-time dashboards, BandAI enables automated geo-specific compliance checks across multiple regions — bridging precision, transparency, and accountability.

## **Key Features**

- **⚙️ Dual-AI Architecture:**  
  Combines a fine-tuned GPT-4.1-mini model for rule detection with a validator AI that cross-checks consistency via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

- **📜 Structured Compliance Output:**  
  Generates interpretable JSON outputs with violation summaries, reasoning, and cited regulation articles for audit traceability.

- **📊 Real-Time Looker Dashboard:**  
  Displays compliance health metrics, regional violation rates, and risk heatmaps for visual analysis and reporting.

- **🔁 Human-in-the-Loop Oversight:**  
  Logs final validated results into Google Sheets for transparent feedback and continuous model improvement.

- **🚀 Streamlit Interface:**  
  Offers an intuitive web interface for instant feature checks, model comparison, and interactive auditing.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Streamlit, FAISS, Pandas, Scikit-Learn  
- **LLM SDKs:** VertexAI, OpenAI API (GPT-4.1-mini fine-tuning)  
- **Data & Automation:** Google Sheets API, JSONL schema pipelines  
- **Visualization:** Looker Studio dashboards  

---

## **Challenges and Learnings**

Building BandAI required balancing **accuracy, latency, and interpretability**.

- Achieved **low latency** through fine-tuning a lightweight GPT-4.1-mini model while preserving audit reliability.  
- Developed a **strict JSONL schema** to enforce structured, reproducible compliance outputs.  
- Introduced a **validator agent** to prevent model drift and improve cross-region decision consistency.  
- Learned that *human-in-the-loop systems* drastically enhance transparency and trust in regulatory AI workflows.

---

## **Outcome**

- ⚡ **60% reduction** in manual compliance review time.  
- ✅ **100% traceable audit trail** for all AI-generated decisions.  
- 🌍 **Cross-region dashboards** reveal compliance hotspots and enable proactive risk management.
